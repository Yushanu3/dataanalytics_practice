    "A **Decision Tree** is a **supervised** learning algorithm used for classification problems. In this algorithm, we split the original data into two or more homogeneous sets. This is done based on most significant attributes to make the resulting groups as distinct as possible. In decision analysis, a decision tree is used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. It uses a tree-like model of decisions. A decision tree is drawn with its **root** at the top and **branches** at the bottom. The branch end that doesn’t split anymore is the **decision / leaf**.\n",

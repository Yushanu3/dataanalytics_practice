You can work in groups of 2-3 students, and model this database on paper (you'll be provided A3 sheets by the tutors) or use the lab machines to design the model on **draw.io**, **Umbrello**, or **Terra ER**. Please state all assumptions you make which are not stated in the problem. Make sure you specify participation constraints as much as possible. Consider what constraints aren't expressible in E-R modelling, and how they might be implemented in a SQL DDL (if possible, not all are!). Complicated constraints often require additional tools such as database triggers (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/plpgsql-trigger.html)\n",

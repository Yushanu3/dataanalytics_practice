    "**Unsupervised Learning** is a class of Machine Learning techniques that find patterns in data. The data given to an unsupervised algorithm are **unlabelled**, which means only the input variables (x) are given with no corresponding output variables. So, an unsupervised learning algorithm is meant to derive strucutre from data without any previous knowledge of what the variables are. In unsupervised learning, the algorithms are left to themselves to discover interesting structures in the data.\n",

    "### Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "In **Supervised Learning**, the constructed model tries to learn from the examples of inputs and outputs that are already provided to it to train it. On the other hand, in **Unsupervised Learning**, the model attempts to find the patterns directly from the given data. So, if the dataset is labelled it comes under a supervised problem, and if the dataset is unlabelled then it is an unsupervised problem.\n",

    "**K-Means Clustering** is a type of **unsupervised** machine learning algorithm, in which we can cluster the data points based on their proximity to a centroid point. Thus, the given data set is divided into _k_ number of clusters. It does this using the following steps - \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The number of clusters **(k)** are picked, and each cluster is represented by its centroid point.\n",
